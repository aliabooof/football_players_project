## Introduction
This project aims to build a data ETLs pipelines to scrape, transform, and load data into BigQuery. The primary objective is to data ingestion and processing for analytics purposes.

## Project Overview
The project consists of two main pipelines:
1. **Pipeline 1**: Scrapes player name codes, performs transformations, and loads the data into BigQuery, creating the dataset and table.
2. **Pipeline 2**: Uses data from BigQuery to scrape detailed player information, performs further cleaning and transformations, and loads the processed data into BigQuery.

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](path/to/architecture-diagram.png)

The architecture consists of:
- **Scraping Services**: Used for data collection.
- **Data Transformation Modules**: For cleaning and transforming the scraped data.
- **BigQuery**: For data storage and querying.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Airflow (included in Docker Compose)
- BeautifulSoup

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Configuration Details
- Update the `airflow.cfg` file with your BigQuery credentials.
- Set environment variables as needed in the `.env` file.

## Data Sources

### Player Name Codes Dataset
- **Source:** [Website URL]
- **Method:** Web scraping using Python (Requests/Scrapy)

### Player Detailed Information Dataset
- **Source:** [API or Website URL]
- **Method:** API calls or additional web scraping

## Data Pipeline

### Pipeline 1
- **Ingestion:** Scrapes player name codes from the website.
- **Transformation:** Cleans and formats the data.
- **Loading:** Inserts the transformed data into BigQuery.

### Pipeline 2
- **Ingestion:** Retrieves data from BigQuery and scrapes detailed player information.
- **Transformation:** Cleans and formats the detailed data.
- **Loading:** Updates BigQuery with the new data.

## Data Storage
- **BigQuery:** The primary data storage solution where datasets and tables are created and maintained.

## Data Processing
- **Tools Used:** Apache Airflow for orchestration, Python for data processing.
- **Frameworks:** [Any specific frameworks or libraries used, e.g., Pandas, NumPy]

## Results
- **Key Metrics:** [Metrics or KPIs tracked, e.g., data volume processed]
- **Visualizations:** [Include any charts or graphs here]

## Conclusion
The project successfully implements a real-time data processing pipeline, enhancing data ingestion and processing efficiency. The integration with BigQuery allows for scalable data storage and querying.

## Future Work
- **Enhancements:** [Suggested improvements, e.g., adding more data sources]
- **Scalability:** [Plans for scaling the pipeline]
